Known Issues:
1. This bookmarklet does not manage signing in the user to the Windows Live account needed to talk to the user's OneNote notebook. So, the user should have signed into the notebook before using this bookmarklet.
2. At times, if the page does not finish loading due to a large number of external network resources to fetch, the clipping may not happen due to page load event issues.
